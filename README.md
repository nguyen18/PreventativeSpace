# PreventativeSpace
Athena Hacks Project

## WHAT IS OUR GAME?

Preventative Space is a game that is aimed to help people understand the importance of preventative actions during a time of great risk to infections/diseases. We aim to educate people how little things in their life can contribute
    to prevention of diseases and what count as necessary precautions people might want to take during time of infection, especially in this time of risk to CoronaVirus. The three fictional diseases the user can play through are: Colapo, Tanessla,
    and Divico. During pandemic times, such as CoronaVirus, SARS, or Pollio, it is important to spread awareness of prevention in order to help protect yourself and others.
